# The `fbingo` Library for Fortran
*Enabling fast and simple statistical simulations of bingo games.*

This Fortran library (currently in the early stages of development) aims to offer an efficient solution for running large-scale and highly-customizable simulations of various bingo patterns. It will be useful for answering the following types of questions:
* How often will a single straight-line bingo game result in multiple winners?
* How often will a coverall happen in under 50 numbers?
* How much faster will a game go if I add a wild number?
